# UnityScript for Atom

UnityScript language support for Atom. It uses 99.9% the patterns from language-javascript. It also includes some snippets.

The snippets are pretty straight forward organized. A commonly used Unity function starts with **uf**, for example to auto-insert a fixed update:


````
uffu <tab>
````

which will insert the following:

````
function FixedUpdate () {

}
````
