# UnityScript for Atom

UnityScript language support for Atom. It uses 99.9% the patterns from language-javascript. Minor changes, such as the use of ToString() instead of toString().  

The snippets are pretty straight forward organized. It is not intended to be a code completion package, but to prevent your UnityScript syntax highlighting breaks when Atom considers it *typical* JavaScript (which it is not...). And as I am lazy combined with UnityScript requiring explicit definitions, these snippets were born.

- shortcut snippets for public/private variables with Unity classes
- shortcut snippets for directives (pragma strict, unity editor)
- shortcut snippets for GameObject (transform, GetComponent, Instantiate, Destroy)
- shortcut snippets for common MonoBehaviour (Awake, Start, Update, FixedUpdate, LateUpdate)
